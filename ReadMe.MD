1) Applying the design-first approach, using an API design tool of your choice, please design a RESTful "Ticketing" API for the following requirements:

- Everyone can see the tickets -> Done

- Only authenticated users can sale or purchase tickets -> De facut controller pentru purchase si pentru sell ( sell e create )

- Only the ticket owner can modify the ticket (e.g. change price)

2) Please implement only the endpoint for updating a ticket described by your design using ASP.NET WebAPI, preferably in C#.

Expectations:

- API design specification for the indicated requirements

- API usage workflows (simplified schema or description) that you envisioned for your design proposal

- Implementation of the indicated endpoint (updating a ticket), functional, to be tested with Postman
